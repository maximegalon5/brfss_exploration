## Introduction

The below is a limited exploratory data analysis on the brfss [data set](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2013.html) for the purposes of an assignment for the Introduction to Probability and Data course offered by Duke University on Coursera [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro). The assignment requires choosing three questions by the program participants based on their interest, the underlying data, and, the learning objectives of the module. Since the data-set is large (over 330 variables) the EDA will focus on variables assumed relevant to the questions being posed by the author.
